Greetings! Welcome to the Toy Language Interpreter repository. Our project is a Java-based interpreter for a simple toy language that provides support for a wide range of features. 

The interpreter supports various data types, including integer, float, boolean, string, and reference data types. You can evaluate arithmetic, logical, and relational expressions, and display results and messages in the interpreter using print statements. You can also implement conditional logic in your code using if statements and support for while and for loops.

In addition, the interpreter allows you to allocate memory for variables at runtime in the heap, and automatically frees memory for unused variables using garbage collection. You can also run multiple threads in parallel and ensure thread safety with synchronized blocks. Moreover, our type checker checks for type errors in your code, making it easier to debug.

One of the standout features of our interpreter is the GUI debugger, which enables you to step through code and inspect variables in a graphical user interface (GUI) debugger. This feature makes it easier to understand and debug code, especially for beginners.
